Welcome travelers!
=================
If fame and fortune are what you seek, you have come to the right place.
This is Oakenshield Inn, where we serve the finest Knights and companions to Venture out on quests.

In order to join the rest of our men, you must run:
`bundle install`
within your console.

Now that you have your equipment, please type:
`ruby bin/run.rb`
within your console.

There will be text prompts, please be sure to answer when asked a question. It is frowned upon in these parts to ignore the innkeeper or respond with nonsense.

_**Pick your Knight**_
After passing your name through, you have options to Review all Knights that have passed through these doors, to add a new knight to the ledge, report a fallen knight, go on a journey with your knight of choice, or go back home.

_**Pick your Adventure**_
From a menu select, enter the number for the path you'd like to follow.

_**Make a choice**_
Go through a trial and put your wits and strength to the test!

_**Head home and sleep**_
After a long days work, why don't you head to bed.
